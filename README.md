<H1 align="center"> Modeling and Forecasting Inflation in the United States<br> <br> Using Stacked Regressions  </center></H1>

<p> This jupyter notebook uses stacked regressions to forecast the inflation rate in the United States. Note that I've created models that perform better and are much more simpler than the solution posted in this notebook. I developed this solution in order to practise stacked regressions.
